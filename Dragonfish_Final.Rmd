# Introduction

Stomiidae is a family of deep-sea ray-finned fish and one of the oldest living species on earth.
One of the most unique features of these fish are their skulls as its shape and specific features tend to vary from species to species.
As such, our research here sought to look into how the head shape of this family has evolved over time.
Previous research that has been done into the family of Stomiidae is relatively limited.
However, one such study done by @sutton1996species had a focus on uniquely preserved as well as novel features such as the pectoral girdle and vertebral column.
In the findings, it was suggested that by the nature of the larger prey Stomiidae target, these anatomical skull features have proven to be beneficial in physically allowing for the engulfing and consumption of their prey.
Another study performed by @kenaley2010comparative have found that other features that some stomiidae contain such as their cephalic photophore was the result of parallel evolution.
Similar studies performed by @fink1985phylogenetic performed a phylogenetic comparison study on the specific features of different stormiidae craniums, but it did not explore the if any significance of the rate of evolutionary change could be found that resulted in these diverse skull shapes.
As such, the goal of our study is to assess skull shape evolution across the Stomiidae, incorporating data from 18 different species in this family.
Data will be collected by characterizing the shape outline of the different specimens to answer the following 3 questions:

1.  What is the evolutionary rate for skull shape?
2.  Is there a significant evolutionary change of skull shape?
3.  Does the evolvability of the skull shape vary significantly among our major recorded lineages of Stomiidae?

# Methods

Images of various species of Dragonfish were digitized using FIJI.

Next, a Procrustes transformation was performed in order to translate, rotate, and scale the outlines for better analysis of their shape without factoring in arbitrary skull size.

Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) was performed in order to describe wing shapes.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was then performed in order to minimize the number of variables explaining the variance in the data set.
The functions for these analyses are included in the R package "Momocs." PCA data was visualized to determine the distribution of morphoshape of the wings of the different species as well as the amount of variance described by different variables.
To prepare the comparative analysis on the PCA data, the phylogenetic tree was loaded positioned upper left.
The file names of each species were also identified using the identifier data provided by Prof. Kenaley.

The PC data was added to the identified species data accordingly.
The phylogeny tree was modified to only include the species that were identified and had a PCA data.
From here, the dragonfish skull PC data was separated in different variable under the Brownian Motion.

To determine the evolutionary rate, "RRphylo" package was used to determine the rate of evolution based on skull shape and from there, any statistically significant shift in shape evolution based on the Dragon fish clades were identified.

The rate of the significant evolutionary shift was identified along with the name of clades.

The phylogenetic independent contrast was performed on the PC datas to separate the original tip data independent of each other.

The PC values of skulls were then compared via linear model and analyzed to see if statistically significant value existed.

# Results

## Shape Analysis

::: {style="text-align: left"}
After visualizing the skull data of the dragonfish species, the skulls were scaled so that the data was adjusted for their difference in size.
This allowed for the contrast of skull shape only.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f <- list.files("CSV Files",pattern=".txt|.csv",full.names = TRUE)
out <- read_delim(f[1],delim="\t") %>% 
  as.matrix()
#transform matrix in momocs outline
out %>% 
  list() %>% 
  Out() %>% 
  coo_flipx() %>% 
  stack()
```

#add species info

  mutate(specie=gsub("\\..+","\\1",basename(filename))) %>% 
  na.omit()

The visualized skulls were then processed through PCA.
This allowed us to see the distribution of skull shapes.

skull.pca %>% 
  plot_PCA(title = "Dragonfish Skulls", labelpoints = T)

## Comparative Analysis

After acquiring the PCA data, the phylogenetic tree of stomidoptera was filtered to only include the species that were included in this study.

```{r, fig.show='hide', display=FALSE}

stom.tree <- ape::read.tree("Stomiidae.tre")
plot(stom.tree,cex=0.1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
stom.tree <- ladderize(stom.tree)
plot(stom.tree,cex=0.1)

stom.tree$tip.label <- gsub("_"," ",stom.tree$tip.label)
basename(names(outs))[1:5]
stom.tree$tip.label

#
out.data <- tibble(xy.file=basename(names(outs))) %>% 
  mutate(species=gsub(".txt","",xy.file))

skull.pca2 <-  tibble(xy.file=basename(rownames(skull.pca$x)),PC1=skull.pca$x[,1],PC2=skull.pca$x[,2]) %>% 
  left_join(out.data)

## Evolutionary Rates

## Shifts in Evolutionary Rates

::: {style="text-align: left"}
The evolutionary shift was then measured to determine if any significant shift in evolutionary rate was present according to the different clades of stomiidae under the Brownian model.
:::

<center>

```{r,include = T}
skullPC1.RR <- RRphylo(tree=stom.tree2,y=skull.pc2)
skullPC1.SS<- search.shift(RR=skullPC1.RR,status.type="clade")
```


```{r, include = F}
plot(stom.tree2)
nodelabels(node = as.numeric(rownames(skullPC1.SS$single.clades)),text = rownames(skullPC1.SS$single.clades))
```

```{r,include = T}
skullPC1.plot <- plotShift(RR=skullPC1.RR,SS=skullPC1.SS)
skullPC1.plot$plotClades()
```

## Shape Evolution Correlation

::: {style="text-align: left"}
The PC1 and PC2 data that underwent phylogenetic independent contrast showed that the PC1 data of skull shape comparison had much more significant correlation compared to the PC2.

# Discussion

Various studies have been done to analyze the macroevolutionary history of stomidopteran forewings and hindwings.
One study by @le2019adaptive links morphology with natural selection, but there is little information known about rates of evolution and correlation of wing shapes.
In this study, we aimed to answer some of these questions about evolutionary history.
We first compared the rate of wing-shape evolution between forewings and hindwings.
Evolutionary rates calculated from PC1 for forewings and hindwings differed by 35.56%, whereas evolutionary rates calculated from PC2 differed by 87.11%, indicating a significant shift in evolutionary rates between forewing and hindwing.
Because forewing and hindwing were found to have different evolutionary rates, we examined shift in evolutionary rates of major lineages as it pertains to both hind- and forewing PC1.
Results obtained from both agreed with each other, in that the clade Macroheterocera: Noctuoidea underwent a downward shift in wing-shape evolutionary rate.
Next, to study fore- and hindwing shape correlation, we examined PC1 and PC2 transformed with phylogenetic information for both.
PIC analysis on fore- and hindwing PC1 showed significant correlation (R-squared: 0.4476), whereas PIC analysis using PC2 found no significant correlation (R-squared: 0.00408).
